      <h1>What is football</h1>
      <p>
        Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees,
        kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally
        means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is
        used. Sports commonly called football include association football
        (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); gridiron football
        (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules
        football; rugby football (either rugby union or rugby league); and
        Gaelic football.These various forms of football share to varying extent
        common origins and are known as football codes. There are a number of
        references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in
        many different parts of the world. Contemporary codes of football can be
        traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools
        during the 19th century.The expansion and cultural influence of the
        British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of
        British influence outside the directly controlled Empire. By the end of
        the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing:
        Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of
        local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage. In
        1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of
        many professional football associations. During the 20th century,
        several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most
        popular team sports in the world.

        <h3>Lionel Messi</h3>
        <p>
          Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, the third of four children
          of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia
          Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his
          father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the
          great-grandson of immigrants from the northcentral Adriatic Marche
          region of Italy and Catalonia, and on his mother's side, he has
          primarily Italian ancestry. Growing up in a tight-knit,
          football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the sport from
          an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and
          Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of
          whom became professional footballers.

      <h2>FIFA BALLOND'OR</h2>
      <p style="column-count: 1">
        The winners of the FIFA Ballon d'Or were chosen by international
        journalists and the coaches and captains of the national teams under
        FIFA's jurisdiction.[3] In a system based on positional voting, each
        voter was allotted three votes, worth five points, three points and one
        point, and the three finalists were ordered based on total number of
        points. Voters were provided with a shortlist of 23 players from which
        they could select the three players they deemed to have performed the
        best in the previous calendar year.

          My name is Vishal Bhardwaj and I am diving deep into CSS and really
          love its reach and power. Many people neglect its true potential and
          just jump to advance things. This is the reason I am making continuous
          projects on CSS.
